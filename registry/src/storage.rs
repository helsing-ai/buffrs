//! # Package Storage trait and implementations.
//!
//! This module contains the [`Storage`] trait, which is used by the buffrs registry to store
//! packages in arbitrary places. Depending on the enabled features, this contains implementations
//! and layers that can be used by the registry.
//!
//! Currently, all package fetches will go through the registry. In the future, it might be
//! implemented to allow the package registry to redirect directly to a presigned URL for a storage
//! endpoint, such as a S3 bucket.

///
/// As the underlying error type used by the implementation is not known, this error type is used
/// to allow errors to be cached when appropriate. Using an [`Arc`] here allows the error to be
/// cloned and stored, while retaining as much information as possible.

///
/// This classifies the errors produced downstream according to their semantics. The only error we
/// really care about at the moment is the `PackageMissing` case, because that one has different

/// # Storage for package sources
///
/// This trait specifies a generic storage implementation for package sources. These will store the
/// compressed tarball containing the package sources.
///
/// ## Error handling
///
/// In general, errors are always passed through and never hidden. That is why there is a
/// [`PackageMissing`][StorageError::PackageMissing] error that is returned rather than the call
/// simply returning an [`Result<Option<Bytes>>`]. This allows downstream users to inspect the
/// errors themselves if needed, and allows for more descriptive error logs.
///
/// The underlying errors are stored as a [`SharedError`], which uses an [`Arc`] to allow errors to
/// be cloned. This allows for caching errors, where it makes sense.
///
/// ## Put semantics
///
/// The semantics of the [`package_put`](Storage::package_put) call are overwrite (rather than
/// error on existing package).  That might be surprising, since packages are considered immutable
/// once published. But the justification for this is that we have a distributed system here, in
/// which the database is the leader.
///
/// In case of an error during package publishing, the transaction that adds the package to the
/// database is not committed, which could result in a package being in storage but not in the
/// database. In that case, the user will retry publishing which should succeed.
///
/// Having dirty data in a caching layer cannot happen because it could only be in the cache if it
/// ends up in the database.
///
/// The database is responsible for avoiding concurrent package publishes that would result in race
/// conditions. Additionally, checksums and signatures are used to verify package sources.

    /// those of overwrite. Refer to the documentation of the trait for more context.

    /// call should only succeed once the package has been successfully written.
