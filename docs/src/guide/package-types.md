## Package Types

Buffrs currently defines three kinds of package: `lib` (library), `api` (API) and `impl` (implementation). Only the first two can publish packages, but it's important to understand all three as they interact with each other in unique ways.

### Libraries

Projects that declare type `lib` in their package manifest publish library packages. Library packages are the most basic kind of package, as they only define primitive types and can have no dependencies. Their purpose is to define a base layer of common types that can be reused by multiple API or implementation packages. This increases compatibility across services by providing a common framework for data representation. It also reduces upgrade issues across evolving projects, as library dependencies tend to change little over time.

### APIs

Projects that declare type `api` in their package manifest publish API packages. API packages, like library packages, are intrinsically declarative. Their distinction is that they are used to define message and services, as opposed to just types. API packages can depend on library packages, so they work with the [`install`](../commands/buffrs-install.md) command, but they don't produce code, so they don't work with the [`generate`](../commands/buffrs-generate.md) command. Implementation packages typically depend on API packages and not directly on libraries, though this is also allowed.

### Implementations

Implementation projects, unlike the other kinds, don't publish packages, so they cannot be referenced as dependencies in packages. However, they do define a package type that can depend on both library and API packages. They are final consumers of reusable protocol buffers and contain the physical implementation of services, or clients and servers -- so they are the intended target of the [`generate`](../commands/buffrs-generate.md) command.
