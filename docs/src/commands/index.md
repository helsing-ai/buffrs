# Buffrs Commands

This section covers detailed documentation on operating the Buffrs CLI. Some of
the content may also apply to the library, particularly the `command` module.

The goal is to provide sufficient information to use the CLI effectively to
manage a Buffrs project, also also capture context and behaviour that may
otherwise be only expressed in code.

The [`help`](buffrs-help.md) command should also provide useful information and is expected to
generally be more up-to-date.
