## buffrs init

Initializes the current directory as a Buffrs project.

### Synopsis

`buffrs init [name]`

`buffrs init --lib [name]`

`buffrs init --api [name]`

### Description

This command prepares the current directory as a Buffrs project, by creating a
manifest file (`Proto.toml`) as well as `proto` and `proto/vendor` directories.

By default, if no name is given, the current directory name is used as the
package name. Note that there are special constraints on valid package names
(see [Package Name Specification](../reference/pkgid-spec.md) for more details).

By default, if no package type is provided, `impl` (implementation) will be
used. The meaning of this is described in [Package
Types](../guide/package-types.md).
