## buffrs

The official Buffrs command-line interface.

### Synopsis

`buffrs`

### Description

When invoked without any arguments, the Buffrs binary defaults to printing out
help information to the standard output.

This is equivalent to [`buffrs help`](buffrs-help.md), or invoking with the `-h`
or `--help` flags.

Providing the `-V` or `--version` flags is also equivalent to `buffrs version`.
