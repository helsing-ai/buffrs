## buffrs uninstall

Deletes all installed dependencies from the local filesystem.

### Synopsis

`buffrs uninstall`

### Description

This command does the reverse operation from the
[`install`](buffrs-uninstall.md) command, and will clear out the `proto/vendors`
directory, thus removing all installed dependencies from the local filesystem. This
is generally safe to do as the `vendors` directory is managed by Buffrs and
shouldn't contain any custom proto files. Subsequently invoking the install
command should restore the exact same files, assuming the lockfile hasn't been
regenerated.
