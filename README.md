## Motivation

Protocol buffers are agreeably a great way to define fully typed,
language-independent API schemas with strong backward compatibility guarantees.
They offer a neat experience for API consumers through generated bindings. *The
biggest problem associated with Protocol Buffers is their distribution.*

- How do you consume the raw protobuf files of one project reliably in another
  one?
- How do you prevent transitive dependencies?
- How do you publish to a unified registry with package format across
  languages?

One obvious way is to generate code bindings in the repository containing the
Protocol Buffers and publish the generated bindings, but this is associated
with problems such as language lock-in. You need to proactively publish
bindings for any possible language your API consumers may use. Also, in
strongly typed languages like Rust, it is hard to extend the behavior of
generated code in consuming projects due to _the orphan rule_. Summing up: this
approach works somehow but hurts frequently.

This is where Buffrs comes in: Buffrs solves this by defining a strict,
package-based distribution mechanism and treats Protocol Buffers as a
first-class citizen.

*This allows you to publish Buffrs packages to a registry and properly depend
on them in other projects.*


## Roadmap

- [x] Support project manifests and dependency declaration
- [x] Support package distribution via Artifactory
- [x] Support tonic as code generation backend
- [x] Support protoc as code generation backend
- [ ] Implement `buffrs-registry`, a self-hostable, S3-based registry.
- [ ] Supply tooling around Protocol Buffers, such as bindgen, linting, and
  formatting.
